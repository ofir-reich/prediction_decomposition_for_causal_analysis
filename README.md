# prediction_decomposition_for_causal_analysis
Decomposition of ML predictions, to be used in causal analysis (e.g. RCTs)

This is the replication code for the paper "Prediction decomposition for causal analysis". It also includes the open-source code to implement the decomposition for interested practitioners (it's in notebook form. Sorry).
